# Project Euler Solutions

These are solutions that I created for various [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.

### Running the Code

When you run each \*.py individually, it will output a single line numerical answer and the runtime in seconds unless the problem specifically asks for a different format. According to the rules, each script will run in under 1 minute.

The *useful_functions* module is for basic functions that I utilize in multiple problems, like generating primes or finding factors of a number.

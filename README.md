# Project Euler Solutions


These are my solutions to some of the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)

When you run each *.py individually, it will output a single line numerical answer unless the problem specifically asks for a different format. According to the rules, each script will run in under 1 minute. For more specific timing information, uncomment the relevant lines or add them if I haven't already.

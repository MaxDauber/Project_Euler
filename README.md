## Project Euler Solutions

These are solutions that I created for various [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.

## Running the Code

When you run each *.py individually, it will output a single line numerical answer unless the problem specifically asks for a different format. According to the rules, each script will run in under 1 minute. For more specific timing information, uncomment the relevant lines or add them if I haven't already.
